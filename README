FastICA is an algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA), first described and
implemenented by Hyvarinen et. al. in the paper "Fast and Robust Fixed-Point
Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis"

The goal of ICA is to find maximally independent components in a mixed dataset.
One example application is separating mixed-sound signals into their individual
signals.

The algorithm was implemented as part of my research/reading with Dejing Dou at
the University of Oregon in Spring 2010. It requires the Incanter framework to
work properly.
